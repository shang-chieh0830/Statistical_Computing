Note that \\(s_0\\) is never computed, \\(s_0\\) is called the seed. Linear congruential generator (LCG) \\(mod \\quad m\\) means that we divide by m and take the remainder(對m取餘) \\(X_n=a(X_{n-1}+c)\\quad mod \\quad m,\\) where \\(X_n \\in \\{0,1,...,m-1\\}, a\\in \\{1,2,...,m-1\\}\\), a is called the multiplier; \\(c\\in \\{0,1,...,m-1\\}\\), c is called the increment; \\(m\\in \\mathcal N=\\{1,2,3,...\\}\\), m is called the modulus. Under LCG, there’s no difference between X and s. That is, \\(X_n\\in\\{0,1,...,m-1\\}:=S,\\quad g(s)=s, \\quad f(X)=(aX+c)\\quad mod\\quad m\\) \\(X_0\\in S\\) is the seed in LCG.

Period Length The computer has only finite memory, so we can’t have infinite state space. It turns out that PRNG starts repeating itself after a while (entering the states that it has already visited). The maximum period length is \\(|S|\\). For LCG, \\(S=\\{0,1,...,m-1\\} \\implies |S|=m\\) Note that random numbers never repeat, but pseudo random numbers DO!! But fortunately, we can have extremely large period in R. Good PRNG have large period. Distribution of samples Aim: generate uniformly distributed samples.\\(U(0,1)\\) For LCG, \\(X_n \\in \\{0,1,...,m-1\\}\\), and we’ve seen from previous examples that LCG is indeed uniformly distributed from \\(\\{0,1,...,m-1\\}\\), note that this is not \\(U(0,1)\\) but at least it’s uniformly distributed. To get \\(U(0,1)\\), use the transformation \\(U_n:=\\frac{X_n+1}{m+1}\\in (0,1)\\) for large m. You can use histogram or check whether the PRNG visits each state exactly once (which then produces every pseudo number once) within its maximum period length. Better criterion: PRNG output passes statistical tests for uniform distribution w/o problems (check example 1.6 in the book) Independence of samples You can just plot \\(X_n\\) and \\(X_{n-1}\\) on x-axis and y-axis respectively. X &lt;- rLCG(1000,8,5,1,0) # m=8 which means small state space, you won&#39;t expect this small m gives you uniformly distributed plot plot(X[1:999], X[2:1000]) X &lt;- rLCG(1000, m=2^32, a=1103515245, c=12345, X0=0) plot(X[1:999], X[2:1000]) # well, it now looks like uniformly distributed U &lt;- (X+1)/(2^32+1) range(U) ## [1] 2.874527e-06 9.979539e-01 round(range(U),4) ## [1] 0.000 0.998 plot(U[1:999], U[2:1000], asp=1) # Great, U(0,1) par(mai=c(0.9,0.9,0.1,0.1)) plot(U[1:999], U[2:1000], asp=1) # Use R&#39;s default PRNG: Mersenne-Twister X &lt;- runif(1000) plot(X[1:999], X[2:1000]) plot(X[1:999], X[2:1000], asp=1) # You can see there&#39;s no discernible pattern In fact, the states are not independent, each state is completely determined by previous state via the function f, you can check the algorithm again. So the states are definitely not independent. But what about those outputs \\(X_1,X_2,...\\) produced by the function g? Well, then you need to choose g properly such that g will lose some information from the states and thus make those outputs \\(X_1,X_2,...\\) independent. So theoretically, they are not independent unless you can choose g cleverly. From our scatter plots above, they actually look quite good. Definition 2.2 k-dimensionally equi-distributed A sequence of numbers is said to be k-dimensionally equidistributed if every k-tuple of possible outputs occurs equally often in this sequence. For example, consider LCG with k=2, we need to consider all pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3),… They are 2 dimensionally equi-distributed if the frequency of all possible pairs converge to the same number. k-dimensionally equi-distributed is what we would expect for a sequence of independent random numbers. Good PRNG has this property for large k. Role of the seed Seed will determine which of the possible output sequences of PRNG we will get. set.seed(1) # always get the same output Reproducible output(for reports or debugging) For non-reproducible output: use techniques like current time of day as the seed. 2.2 The inverse transform method 2.3 Rejection sampling "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
